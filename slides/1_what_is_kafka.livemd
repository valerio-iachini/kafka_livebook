Kafka is an event streaming platform.

> üìΩÔ∏è Kafka was created to address the data pipeline problem at LinkedIn. It was designed to provide a high-performance messaging system that can handle many types of data and provide clean, structured data about user activity and system metrics in real time.

An **event** is a thing that happend combined with the description of what happened.

<p style="text-align: center; weight">
  <b>NOTIFICATION (When-ness to the thing) + STATE (description)</b>
</p>

The state is typically represented using JSON, JSON Schema, AVRO, or Protobuf. **An event in Kafka is a key-value pair (sequence of bytes)**. Internally, **Kafka is loosely typed**.

The **key** for an event in Kafka can be a complex domain object, but it is often a primitive type like a string or integer. The key typically serves as an **identifier for a domain object**.

E.g. `vendor_id`
